<p class="box"><strong>Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey</strong> is <cite>my least favorite ride</cite>. I went on that ride four times so far.

My first time was in July 2017. I felt that ride go (almost) upside down. I didn't want to ride that ride ever again after that.
I, unfortunately, rode that ride again in December 2017 and June 2018. I still did not like that ride. The June 2018 ride was the worst one.
The ride stopped three times.

My most recent ride was in June 2022. My cousin forced me to ride on it with him, my friend, and my friend's dad.
They've already ridden the ride a few minutes ago but they wanted to go again. The line was about five minutes because we had fast pass.
The ride didn't stop at all that time and we survived. I don't know how we survived but I still don't want to go on that ride ever again.</p>
