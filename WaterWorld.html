WaterWorld is not for people who hate listening to loud noises. That's because the actors tell their group of audience scream after they scream.
It's loud because your group of audience all scream at about the same time and it could hurt your ears.
If you are not sensitive to smoke effects, getting wet, loud noises, or jokes, this show is for you.
<br>
Oh, you all want to hear my personal opinion? This hurts my ears because as I've mentioned before, the groups of audience scream because their actors tell them to scream.
I also don't sit on the green seats because I don't want to get wet. I would also not volunteer to get off the bleachers to be close to an actor because I would get wet if I do that.
The parts after the intro are better because the actors finally stop forcing their group of audience to scream and start performing WaterWorld.
They still get some of their audience wet because that part of the audience sits on the green seats.
