    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      I went to Milpitas Extension from June 27 to July 21.
      My classes were from Mondays to Thursdays and from 10 AM to 2 PM.
      The only Monday we didn't attend these classes was July 4.
      There were 39 students and about nine teachers. Two students dropped out.
      We were divided into two groups. My group learned about mental health and college stuff first.
      We did study hall last. The other group did study hall first.
      They learned about mental health and college stuff last.
      The groups were together when their professor taught HTML and lunch.
      On the first week, they gave us Subway for lunch.
      After the first week, they give us Subway every Monday and Wednesday and Pizza Box every Tuesday and Thursday.
      We had a final exam on July 21 in our mental health class.
      We also had to present our websites in our study hall from July 19 to July 21.
      <br>Yes, I presented this website to my class because this website was made for Milpitas Extension.

      I couldn't find a non-copyrighted image of Milpitas Extension so I will describe its outside.
      The walls are maroon and sand. The phrase "SJECCD COLLEGE EXTENSON" can be found on the front wall.
      A flag pole showing the US flag and the California flag can be seen in front of the building.
